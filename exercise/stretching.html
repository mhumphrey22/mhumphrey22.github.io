    <h2>Comprehensive Full-Body Warm-Up Sheet</h2>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prepares the body for heavy barbell lifting (e.g., Starting Strength). Combines lower body mobility (Limber 11) with upper body activation and joint prep.</p>
    <p><strong>Estimated Total Time:</strong> 20–25 minutes</p>

    <h3>Lower Body (Limber 11 - ~10–15 minutes)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Foam Roll IT Band</strong> – 10-15 passes per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Lie on your side with the foam roller placed just below your hip and slowly roll down toward your knee, targeting the outer thigh. Support yourself with your upper body and opposite leg to control pressure. While the IT band itself doesn’t stretch easily, this technique helps relieve tension and reduce friction around the hip and knee, especially useful for runners and lifters.<br>

        <li><strong>Foam Roll Adductors</strong> – 10-15 passes per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Position yourself face down with one leg bent out to the side and the foam roller under your inner thigh (adductor area). Roll slowly from the groin to just above the knee. This is great for opening up the inner thighs and improving hip abduction, which supports better squat mechanics.<br>

        <li><strong>Foam Roll Glutes</strong> – 30s-2m per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Sit on the foam roller with one ankle crossed over the opposite knee in a figure-four position. Lean into the glute of the crossed leg and roll slowly. This targets the glute max and piriformis, helping release tension that contributes to back or hip pain and prepares the posterior chain for loading.<br>

        <li><strong>Bent-Knee Iron Cross</strong> – 5-10 reps per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Lie flat on your back with both arms extended at shoulder level. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and slowly rotate your legs side to side, aiming to touch the ground. This controlled twist activates and stretches the lower back and hips, improving rotational mobility in the lumbar spine and thoracic region.<br>

        <li><strong>Rollovers to V-Sits</strong> – 10 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Begin lying on your back, then roll your legs over your head and transition into a seated V-sit with legs extended. This movement dynamically mobilizes the spine, hamstrings, and hips. It also activates core control and builds fluidity between posterior chain movement patterns.<br>

        <li><strong>Rocking Frog Stretch</strong> – 10 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Start on all fours with knees wide and feet turned out. Lower your hips back and then rock forward again, keeping your spine neutral. This dynamic movement stretches the groin and adductors while improving hip external rotation—ideal for deep squat prep.<br>

        </video></li>

        <li><strong>Fire Hydrants</strong> – 10 reps per side, forwards and backwards<br>
        <em>Description:</em> In a quadruped (hands and knees) position, lift one knee out to the side while keeping it bent at 90 degrees. Perform circles forward and backward. This strengthens the glute medius and improves hip control, helping stabilize the pelvis during loaded lower-body movements.<br>

        <li><strong>Mountain Climbers</strong> – 10 reps per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> From a plank position, alternate driving your knees toward your chest rapidly. This increases heart rate and body temperature, while dynamically activating the hip flexors, core, and shoulders. It’s a powerful metabolic warm-up and great prep for squats or deadlifts.<br>

        <li><strong>Cossack Squats</strong> – 5-10 reps per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Stand with feet in a wide stance. Shift your weight onto one leg, squatting down while keeping the other leg extended. Keep your chest upright and heel down. This stretch improves hip adduction, hamstring flexibility, and lateral mobility — especially useful for athletic movement patterns and deep squatting.<br>

        <li><strong>Seated Piriformis Stretch</strong> – 20-30s per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Sit on the ground with one leg extended and the other crossed over. Hug the bent knee toward your chest, rotating your torso slightly toward it. This deeply stretches the piriformis and glute muscles, reducing hip tightness and alleviating lower back pressure or sciatica symptoms.<br>

        <li><strong>Rear-foot-elevated Hip Flexor Stretch</strong> – 5x10 reps, with 3s hold, per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> In a lunge position, place your back foot on a bench or box. Push your hips forward while staying tall and squeezing the glute of the back leg. This intensifies the stretch in the hip flexor and quad of the rear leg — essential for those who sit a lot or struggle to hit full depth in squats.<br>
