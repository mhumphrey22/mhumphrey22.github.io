    <h2>Comprehensive Full-Body Warm-Up Sheet</h2>
    <p><strong>Purpose:</strong> Prepares the body for heavy barbell lifting (e.g., Starting Strength). Combines lower body mobility (Limber 11) with upper body activation and joint prep.</p>
    <p><strong>Estimated Total Time:</strong> 20–25 minutes</p>

    <h3>Lower Body (Limber 11 - ~10–15 minutes)</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Foam Roll IT Band</strong> – 10-15 passes per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Lie on your side with the foam roller placed just below your hip and slowly roll down toward your knee, targeting the outer thigh. Support yourself with your upper body and opposite leg to control pressure. While the IT band itself doesn’t stretch easily, this technique helps relieve tension and reduce friction around the hip and knee, especially useful for runners and lifters.<br>

        <li><strong>Foam Roll Adductors</strong> – 10-15 passes per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Position yourself face down with one leg bent out to the side and the foam roller under your inner thigh (adductor area). Roll slowly from the groin to just above the knee. This is great for opening up the inner thighs and improving hip abduction, which supports better squat mechanics.<br>

        <li><strong>Foam Roll Glutes</strong> – 30s-2m per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Sit on the foam roller with one ankle crossed over the opposite knee in a figure-four position. Lean into the glute of the crossed leg and roll slowly. This targets the glute max and piriformis, helping release tension that contributes to back or hip pain and prepares the posterior chain for loading.<br>

        <li><strong>Bent-Knee Iron Cross</strong> – 5-10 reps per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Lie flat on your back with both arms extended at shoulder level. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and slowly rotate your legs side to side, aiming to touch the ground. This controlled twist activates and stretches the lower back and hips, improving rotational mobility in the lumbar spine and thoracic region.<br>

        <li><strong>Rollovers to V-Sits</strong> – 10 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Begin lying on your back, then roll your legs over your head and transition into a seated V-sit with legs extended. This movement dynamically mobilizes the spine, hamstrings, and hips. It also activates core control and builds fluidity between posterior chain movement patterns.<br>

        </video></li>

        <li><strong>Fire Hydrants</strong> – 10 reps per side, forwards and backwards<br>
        <em>Description:</em> In a quadruped (hands and knees) position, lift one knee out to the side while keeping it bent at 90 degrees. Perform circles forward and backward. This strengthens the glute medius and improves hip control, helping stabilize the pelvis during loaded lower-body movements.<br>

        <li><strong>Mountain Climbers</strong> – 10 reps per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> From a plank position, alternate driving your knees toward your chest rapidly. This increases heart rate and body temperature, while dynamically activating the hip flexors, core, and shoulders. It’s a powerful metabolic warm-up and great prep for squats or deadlifts.<br>

        <li><strong>Cossack Squats</strong> – 5-10 reps per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Stand with feet in a wide stance. Shift your weight onto one leg, squatting down while keeping the other leg extended. Keep your chest upright and heel down. This stretch improves hip adduction, hamstring flexibility, and lateral mobility — especially useful for athletic movement patterns and deep squatting.<br>

        <li><strong>Seated Piriformis Stretch</strong> – 20-30s per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Sit on the ground with one leg extended and the other crossed over. Hug the bent knee toward your chest, rotating your torso slightly toward it. This deeply stretches the piriformis and glute muscles, reducing hip tightness and alleviating lower back pressure or sciatica symptoms.<br>

        <li><strong>Rear-foot-elevated Hip Flexor Stretch</strong> – 5x10 reps, with 3s hold, per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> In a lunge position, place your back foot on a bench or box. Push your hips forward while staying tall and squeezing the glute of the back leg. This intensifies the stretch in the hip flexor and quad of the rear leg — essential for those who sit a lot or struggle to hit full depth in squats.<br>

    <h3>Upper Body Activation + Mobility (~10 minutes)</h3>
    <ol start="1">
        <li><strong>Wall Slides</strong> – 2x10 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Stand against a wall with your lower back, shoulders, and arms in contact. Slowly slide your arms up and down like a snow angel, keeping contact throughout. This opens up the thoracic spine and shoulders while reinforcing proper scapular mechanics — critical for pressing and pulling movements.<br>

        <li><strong>Band Pull-Aparts</strong> – 2x15 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Hold a light resistance band at shoulder height with arms extended. Pull the band apart until your arms are fully spread, squeezing your shoulder blades together. This activates the upper back (rhomboids, traps) and improves posture and shoulder stability before pressing or pulling.<br>

        <li><strong>Scapular Wall Angels</strong> – 2x10 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Similar to wall slides but with more focus on scapular control, this drill has you slowly raise and lower your arms against a wall while retracting and rotating your shoulder blades. It’s ideal for strengthening postural support and building mobility through the shoulder joint.<br>

        <li><strong>Banded Shoulder Dislocates</strong> – 2x15 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Using a resistance band or PVC pipe, hold wide and pass the band over your head and behind your back, then reverse. This improves shoulder flexion and external rotation, helping warm up for overhead lifts like presses or snatches. Go slow and stay within a pain-free range.<br>
        <video src="https://i.imgur.com/zReExz4.gif" autoplay loop muted></video></li>

        <li><strong>Thoracic Spine Extensions</strong> – 1–2 minutes<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Lie back on a foam roller positioned across your upper back. Support your head and arch gently over the roller to extend the spine. This mobilizes the thoracic spine, improving posture and overhead lifting capability. Don’t overextend—focus on controlled movement.<br>
        <video src="https://i.imgur.com/M4ANP3g.gif" autoplay loop muted></video></li>

        <li><strong>Doorway Pec Stretch</strong> – 30 seconds per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Place your forearm on the edge of a doorway at a 90-degree angle and gently lean forward. You should feel the stretch across the chest and front of the shoulder. This reduces anterior shoulder tightness, which can restrict pressing and pulling range of motion.<br>

    </ol>

    <h3>Optional Additions (as needed)</h3>
    <ol start="1">
        <li><strong>Face Pulls (Band)</strong> – 2x15 reps<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Anchor a band at eye level and pull it toward your face while flaring your elbows. Focus on squeezing the shoulder blades together. This improves posture, scapular strength, and helps prevent shoulder impingement — especially valuable for pressing athletes.<br>
        <video src="https://i.imgur.com/yZLhCNY.gif" autoplay loop muted></video></li>

        <li><strong>Child’s Pose + Side Reach</strong> – 30 seconds per side<br>
        <em>Description:</em> Begin in child’s pose, then walk your hands to one side to feel a stretch through the opposite lat and thoracic spine. This increases mobility in the side body, useful for overhead pressing and deep breathing mechanics.<br>
        <video src="https://i.imgur.com/9U6PjQh.gif" autoplay loop muted></video></li>

        <li><strong>Ankle Dorsiflexion Stretch</strong> – 1–2 mins per ankle<br>
        <em>Description:</em> While standing or kneeling, drive your knee over your toe while keeping your heel flat on the ground. This mobilizes the ankle joint and increases dorsiflexion, which is essential for achieving deep, upright squats without heel lift or knee collapse.<br>
